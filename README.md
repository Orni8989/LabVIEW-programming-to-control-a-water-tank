# Water Tank Control and Flow Analysis Laboratory  

## Overview  
This repository contains LabVIEW programs developed for a laboratory experiment focusing on water tank control, data collection, and flow analysis. The lab consists of three main tasks:  

1. **Water Tank Control** â€“ Regulating a water tank with outflow and feedback via a pump.  
2. **Water Level Plotting** â€“ Recording and plotting the water level over time using a pen plotter.  
3. **Shape Determination** â€“ Determining the shape of an unknown axisymmetric object based on fluid dynamics principles.  

The system is controlled using a power supply for the pump and a pressure sensor for water level measurements. LabVIEW is used for both system control and data acquisition.  

## Achievements  
This lab was conducted by **Carl Ã–rnberg and Ludvig**, and we received a **grade of 5/5** for our work.  

## Repository Structure  
The following files correspond to different tasks in the lab:  

| File Name                     | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `upg3_proportionalitetskonstant`  | Measures the proportionality constant. |
| `upg3_pumpstyrare`  | Controls the system for task 3. |
| `upg4,5_datainsamling`  | Collects height data for tasks 4 and 5. |
| `upg4_penplotter`  | Algorithm that plots height data points using the pen plotter. |
| `upg5_undersÃ¶kstruktur`  | Computes the radius of the unknown object at a given height. |

## Usage  
1. Run `upg3_proportionalitetskonstant` to determine the proportionality constant.  
2. Use `upg3_pumpstyrare` to control the pump in task 3.  
3. Execute `upg4,5_datainsamling` to gather height data.  
4. Utilize `upg4_penplotter` to visualize the collected data.  
5. Run `upg5_undersÃ¶kstruktur` to analyze the structure of the unknown object.
